## Introduction to Array

In this chapter, we are going to introduce two important concepts: array and dynamic array.

These are the basic data structure you should be familiar with. We also provide a tutorial for you to use the built-in array and dynamic array.

## By completing this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

1. What is the difference between array and dynamic array?

- An array has a fixed capacity so we need to specify the size when we initialize it. It occupies a conigous block in memory.
- A dynamic array is an array whose size can be modified during runtime without the need to specify how large the array is beforehand. Once the array is filled, it will allocate a bigger chunk of memory, copy the contents from the original array into this new space, and continue to fill the availble slots.

2. What is the corresponding built-in data structure of array and dynamic array in your frequently-used language?

- C++ has a vector.
- Java has ArrayList.
- Python has

3. How to perform basic operations (initialization, data access, modification, iteration, sort, etc) in an array?
4. How to perform basic operations (initialization, data access, modification, iteration, sort, addition, deletion, etc) in a dynamic array?
